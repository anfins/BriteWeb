So, we held back from asking which diminished our learning. We were fortunate enough to make it through university, but many students aren't.
        
                            Additionally, we were only able to notify our professors with student-feedback once at the very end of each semester, so there was a huge disconnect present. Our team realized that by the time professors get this feedback, the students who needed the class adjustment most had either already failed, or dropped the course. After talking with professors at leading colleges across the country, we learned they were frustrated too.
                            
                            These familiar challenges inspired us to build an in-class app, Brite, to solve the issues we faced as students, and to give educators an easy to use platform that eases their problems. Our mission is to empower students to overcome systemic barriers by providing innovative solutions and support. We believe that every student deserves a fair chance at achieving their academic goals, regardless of their background or circumstances. By leveraging technology and data, we aim to create a more equitable and inclusive platform that sets students up for success. </p>
